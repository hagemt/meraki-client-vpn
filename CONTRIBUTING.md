# How to contribute to Merlink

## Contributing Code
### **Getting Started (With PyCharm)**

**1.** Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/pocc/merlink```

**2.** Setup PyCharm

For detailed instructions on how to do this, go to [ENV_SETUP](https://github.com/pocc/merlink/blob/merlink/ENV_SETUP.md)

### **Programming Resources**
* Programming Resources: 
    * [Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/)
    * [Qt 5.10](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/)
    * [PyQt](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html)
    * [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
    * [Mechanical Soup](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup)
    
Qt's documentation of libraries is more extensive than PyQt's. If there is a library you have questions about, Qt's documentation will be superior, and the C++ code *mostly* translates.
